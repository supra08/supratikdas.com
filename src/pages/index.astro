		<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">Some things about me:</h2>
		<ul class="mb-4 list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
			<li>Have loved being on computers probably since the beginning</li>
			<li>
				An uncle taught me to program in C++ when I was 11. C++ graphics was intimidating, so taught
				myself QBASIC. Built my first Pacman using that
			</li>
			<li>Been fiddling around with computers and RC planes</li>
			<li>
				Joined IIT Roorkee for my undergrad in 2017. Went to become a part of a coveted society
				called SDSLabs
			</li>
			<li>
				2018: Figured how beautiful AI can be. 2019: Figured how beautiful distributed systems can
				be. My pursuit began to build something in that intersection
			</li>
			<li>2022: Founded Dashwave, a cloud platform running AI Agents to build Mobile Apps</li>
			<li>
				I also play guitar occasionally, having performed in school and college a handful of times.
				I am currently (will update on the status) building a DIY rig to try British amps without
				waking up my neighbors
			</li>
